## How to Run the script 
Image Embedding: python3 mimage.py [replace snapshot folder name]
Text Embedding: python3 mtext.py [replace text description folder name]

For image embedding, each embedding would be saved to an individual file
For text embedding, inside each source folder, a new folder called "textemb" would be created containing all the embeddings.
